# CollabTainer
This is intended to be a starter example container to house various apps which might
work together on common tasks. Apps might take outputs of other apps for interactive
visualiation. An app might connect other apps together in a pipeline. The container
might also support multiple contributers, working together in a modular way. Each app
might be installed with a separate set of dependency versions, using Conda or Julia
Project environments. This particular container bootstraps a container provisioned
with Julia, Micromamba, and R.

## [Scientific Filesystem](https://sci-f.github.io) (SCIF)
(Vanessa Sochat; The Scientific Filesystem (SCIF), GigaScience, giy023, https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy023)

This container leverages SCIF. The [scif](https://pypi.org/project/scif/) tool is used
to install and utilze apps under a simple, standard directory structure, under
a `/scif` directory in the created container. There is also a [scif](scif) directory in
this repository. That is only to contain as-needed files which we might want to copy over
to app-specific locations. But this is _not_ meant to contain all the files and directories
to instantiate the full scif directory structure. The scif tool will do that, based on the
[scif recipe file](collabtainer.scif). The repo's scif directory is a good place to keep small
app config files, like Conda `enviroment.yml` files or Julia `Project.toml` files. But it is encouraged
to pull in as many things via reliable reference. E.g. (shallow) clone a Github repo into an app's
lib directory, via `%appinstall` sections in the recipe file.

## Quickstart
The scif tool is used as the entrypoint to interface with the container apps. You can take a look
at what is available by just calling `--help` on at built container.
E.g,
```bash
# apptainer build CollabTainer.sif Apptainer
./CollabTainer.sif --help
usage: scif [-h] [--debug] [--quiet] [--writable] {version,pyshell,shell,preview,help,install,inspect,run,test,apps,dump,exec} ...

scientific filesystem tools

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug               use verbose logging to debug.
  --quiet               suppress print output
  --writable, -w        for relevant commands, if writable SCIF is needed
